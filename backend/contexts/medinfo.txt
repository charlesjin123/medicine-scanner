Cough syrup is used to relieve coughing caused by colds, flu, or other conditions. It often contains ingredients like dextromethorphan, which helps suppress cough, and guaifenesin, which is an expectorant that helps loosen mucus in the chest, making it easier to cough up. 
Some cough syrups may also include antihistamines like diphenhydramine, which can help with runny nose and sneezing. Cough syrup should be taken every 4 to 6 hours as needed, but not more than 6 doses in 24 hours. 
It's important to follow the dosage instructions on the label and not to use more than recommended. Cough syrup can cause drowsiness, so it should be used with caution, especially when driving or operating heavy machinery. 

Ibuprofen is used to relieve pain from various conditions such as headache, dental pain, muscle aches, or arthritis. It is also used to reduce fever 
and to relieve minor aches and pain due to the common cold or flu. Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by blocking 
your body's production of certain natural substances that cause inflammation. This effect helps to decrease swelling, pain, or fever.
If you are treating a chronic condition such as arthritis, ask your doctor about non-drug treatments and/or using other medications to treat your pain.

Aspirin is used to reduce fever and relieve mild to moderate pain from conditions such as muscle aches, toothaches, common cold, and headaches.
It may also be used to reduce pain and swelling in conditions such as arthritis. Aspirin is known as a salicylate and a nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by blocking a certain natural substance in your body to reduce pain and swelling.
Take 2 tablets every 4 to 6 hours, with a maximum of 8 tablets in a 24-hour period.
