Cough syrup is used to relieve coughing caused by colds, flu, or other conditions. It often contains ingredients like dextromethorphan, which helps suppress cough, and guaifenesin, which is an expectorant that helps loosen mucus in the chest, making it easier to cough up. 
Some cough syrups may also include antihistamines like diphenhydramine, which can help with runny nose and sneezing. Cough syrup should be taken every 4 to 6 hours as needed, but not more than 6 doses in 24 hours. 
It's important to follow the dosage instructions on the label and not to use more than recommended. Cough syrup can cause drowsiness, so it should be used with caution, especially when driving or operating heavy machinery. 

Ibuprofen is used to relieve pain from various conditions such as headache, dental pain, muscle aches, or arthritis. It is also used to reduce fever 
and to relieve minor aches and pain due to the common cold or flu. Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by blocking 
your body's production of certain natural substances that cause inflammation. This effect helps to decrease swelling, pain, or fever.
If you are treating a chronic condition such as arthritis, ask your doctor about non-drug treatments and/or using other medications to treat your pain.

Aspirin is used to reduce fever and relieve mild to moderate pain from conditions such as muscle aches, toothaches, common cold, and headaches.
It may also be used to reduce pain and swelling in conditions such as arthritis. Aspirin is known as a salicylate and a nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by blocking a certain natural substance in your body to reduce pain and swelling. Take 2 tablets every 4 to 6 hours, with a maximum of 8 tablets in a 24-hour period.

Acetaminophen is used to relieve mild to moderate pain from headaches, menstrual periods, toothaches, backaches, osteoarthritis, or cold and flu aches and pains. 
It is also effective in reducing fever. Acetaminophen works by blocking the production of certain chemicals in the brain that signal pain. It is important to follow 
the dosage instructions on the label carefully and not to exceed the recommended dose, as excessive use can lead to liver damage. 
Adults should not take more than 3,000 milligrams in a 24-hour period unless directed by a doctor.

a natural substance your body makes during an allergic reaction. Loratadine is usually taken once daily, with or without food. It is important to follow the dosage instructions 
on the label and not to take more than recommended. Loratadine typically does not cause drowsiness when used at the recommended doses.

Pseudoephedrine is a decongestant used to relieve nasal congestion caused by colds, allergies, and hay fever. It works by narrowing the blood vessels in the nasal passages, which 
reduces swelling and congestion. Pseudoephedrine is usually taken every 4 to 6 hours as needed, but should not exceed the maximum recommended dose. Be sure to read and follow the 
dosage instructions on the label carefully. This medication may cause nervousness, dizziness, or difficulty sleeping in some individuals.

needed, following the directions on the product label. Chewable tablets should be chewed thoroughly before swallowing. Do not exceed the recommended dosage, as overuse may lead to 
side effects like constipation or kidney stones. If symptoms persist, consult a healthcare professional.

Loperamide is used to treat sudden diarrhea, including traveler's diarrhea. It works by slowing down gut movement, which decreases the number of bowel movements and makes the stool
less watery. Loperamide is typically taken after each loose stool, but should not exceed the maximum recommended dose in a 24-hour period. It is important to stay hydrated while 
using this medication. Do not use loperamide for more than two days unless directed by a doctor.

Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine used to relieve symptoms of allergy, hay fever, and the common cold. These symptoms include rash, itching, watery eyes, cough, runny nose, and sneezing. 
It works by blocking histamine and acetylcholine in the body, which helps decrease allergy symptoms. Diphenhydramine can cause drowsiness, so it should be used with caution, especially when 
driving or operating heavy machinery. Follow the dosage instructions on the label and do not take more than recommended.

Cetirizine is an antihistamine used to relieve allergy symptoms such as watery eyes, runny nose, itching eyes or nose, and sneezing. It works by blocking histamine, a natural substance that 
the body produces during an allergic reaction. Cetirizine is typically taken once daily, with or without food. It usually does not cause drowsiness when used at the recommended dose, but 
some people may still experience this effect. Always follow the dosage instructions on the label and do not exceed the recommended amount.

Hydrocortisone cream is a topical corticosteroid used to treat a variety of skin conditions like insect bites, eczema, dermatitis, allergies, and rash. It helps reduce swelling, itching, and
redness by suppressing the immune response in the affected area. Apply a thin layer to the affected skin as directed, usually two to four times daily. Do not use hydrocortisone cream on broken 
or infected skin unless advised by a healthcare provider. Prolonged use can lead to skin thinning and other side effects.

Saline nasal sprays are used to relieve nasal congestion and dryness caused by colds, allergies, or dry air. They work by moisturizing nasal passages and thinning mucus, making it easier to breathe.
Saline sprays can be used as needed and are safe for all ages, including infants. They contain no medication and generally have no side effects, making them a gentle option for nasal relief.

Hydrocolloid bandages are specialized wound dressings used to promote healing of minor cuts, scrapes, burns, and blisters. They work by maintaining a moist environment that helps tissue regenerate 
and can reduce scarring. The bandage absorbs wound exudate and forms a gel-like substance that keeps the area moist. Apply to clean, dry skin and leave in place for several days unless it becomes 
saturated or dislodged. They are generally well-tolerated with minimal risk of side effects.

Benadryl is an antihistamine used to relieve symptoms of allergies, hay fever, and the common cold, such as itching, runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes. It works by blocking histamine, a natural
substance your body produces during an allergic reaction. Take as directed on the product label or by a healthcare professional, usually every 4 to 6 hours as needed. Use caution when driving or 
operating machinery, as Benadryl may cause drowsiness. It is generally well-tolerated with minimal risk of side effects, but some individuals may experience dizziness, dry mouth, or blurred vision.

Dextromethorphan is a cough suppressant used to relieve a non-productive cough caused by the common cold or other conditions. It acts on the brain's cough center to reduce the urge to cough. 
Dextromethorphan is found in many over-the-counter cough and cold preparations. It is usually taken every 4 to 12 hours as needed, depending on the formulation. Always follow the dosing instructions 
on the label and avoid exceeding the recommended dose to prevent side effects like dizziness or drowsiness.

Bismuth subsalicylate is used to treat temporary discomforts of the stomach and gastrointestinal tract, such as diarrhea, heartburn, nausea, and upset stomach. It works by protecting the stomach lining
and reducing inflammation. The medication is typically taken every 30 to 60 minutes as needed, but not exceeding the maximum recommended dose. Side effects may include a temporary darkening of the stool
or tongue, which is harmless. If symptoms persist for more than two days, seek medical advice.
